# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Java Backend Academy main branch: revamp the BATCHES page.
  - Students can only view batches & enrol (not create).
  - Batches are owner-managed via a Google Sheet (mirrors reviews-apps-script.gs).
  - Show only upcoming batches, per-course; flag same-course date overlaps.
  - All content (dates/time/days/mode/instructor/price/notes/seats) is configurable in sheet.
  - Track slots-left per batch server-side (seats_total − seats_taken).
  - Handle 4 enrolment intents: ENROL / OPT_OUT / TAKING / INTERESTED (undecided).
  - Security: sheet ID lives only inside Apps Script, GET is read-only + hides
    past/closed batches, POST is append-only to a separate "enrollments" tab with
    approved=FALSE, IP rate-limited, allow-listed intents, batch_id validated
    against sheet before accepting ENROL/OPT_OUT.

frontend:
  - task: "Course-wise reviews filter"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "frontend/src/site/Reviews.jsx, frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx"
    stuck_count: 0

            - Wrote /docs/batches-apps-script.gs (mirrors reviews Apps Script model):
              • Owner-only sheet with tabs `batches` and `enrollments`.
              • Sheet ID lives ONLY inside the script — never in the website bundle.
              • doGet returns only rows where enrollment_open=TRUE AND hidden!=TRUE AND
                start_date >= today, drops rows whose course_n isn't in ALLOWED_COURSES,
                computes seats_left server-side, and flags in-course date overlaps.
              • doPost is append-only to `enrollments`, always writes approved=FALSE,
                validates intent against ALLOWED_INTENTS, cross-checks batch_id+course_n
                against the batches sheet for ENROL/OPT_OUT, IP throttles 1/60s.
              • Nothing here ever mutates the batches sheet.
            - Added REACT_APP_BATCHES_API to frontend/.env (empty by default — safe
              seed fallback until owner deploys the script). Exposed BATCHES_API_URL
              and BATCH_INTENTS in content.js.
            - Rewrote frontend/src/site/Batches.jsx end-to-end:
              • Fetches from BATCHES_API_URL, normalises payload, renders skeleton
                while loading, falls back to seed with a subtle banner on error.
              • Course chips (All + one per course with data) filter the grid.
              • Batch card shows dates, time, days, mode, instructor, price, notes,
                slots pill (green/amber/red/sold-out) and an "Overlaps in-course"
                warning ribbon when the Apps Script marks overlap:true.
              • Enrolment modal with 4 intents (ENROL / OPT_OUT / TAKING / INTERESTED),
                course + batch dropdowns auto-populated from the clicked card;
                client-side length caps; POST uses text/plain to avoid CORS preflight.
              • Empty-state "Notify me" CTA that opens the modal in INTERESTED mode
                pre-filled with the current filter.
            - Verified in headless browser: chips (All 03, 01/03/05 each 01),
              filter to Course 03 shows only Databases card, Enrol click opens the
              modal with the right course+batch preselected, seed banner visible
              because REACT_APP_BATCHES_API is unset.

            Batches feature is intentionally NOT backed by FastAPI. Owner-only mutation
            comes from a Google Sheet fronted by /docs/batches-apps-script.gs — the
            same immutability model as reviews. Nothing on FastAPI touched.

      message: |
        Batches page rebuilt on the same trust model as reviews:
          • The Google Sheet ID lives inside the Apps Script only.
          • Public site sees a Web App URL that is strictly read-only for
            batches and append-only (approved=FALSE) for enrollments.
          • Slots-left is computed server-side; the site cannot inflate seats.
          • Overlap detection runs in Apps Script; owner sees a warning ribbon.
        Until the owner deploys /docs/batches-apps-script.gs and sets
        REACT_APP_BATCHES_API in frontend/.env, the page renders a small seed
        so nothing breaks. Once the env var is set, the sheet is the single
        source of truth. No FastAPI routes touched.
